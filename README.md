# Classifying-Patients-with-Heart-Disease-Using-Decision-Trees
This project employs decision trees to classify patients with heart disease.

# Project Description
In this project, I construct a decision tree that classifies patients with heart disease. Accuracy of the classification tree is improved using cost complexity pruning and k-fold cross validation. The result is a decision tree that performs very well at classifying cases of heart disease. The tree is 76.9% accurate at classifying patients who do not have heart disease, and it is 81.0% accurate at classifying patients that do have heart disease.

# Primary Aim
Given a dataset containing patient health information, I need to construct a decision tree that successfully classifies patients with heart disease. To be successful, the decision tree must achieve an accuracy score that is greater or equal to 70%.

# Methodology and Strategy
I employ several data science tools and techniques to achieve the overall aim of the project. The project proceeds in the following way.

1. Import the libraries and data.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis.
3. Cleanse and process the data.
4. Build and evaluate a decision tree.
5. Employ cost coomplexity pruning.
6. Employ k-folds cross validation.
7. Construct and evaluate the improved tree.
8. Summarize the project and results.
